#  Financial Dashboard
Welcome to the **Financial Dashboard**, an interactive web application built with Streamlit that empowers users to visualize and analyze stock market data seamlessly.
##  Project Overview
This dashboard allows users to enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA) and explore historical stock price data with customizable periods and intervals. Powered by Yahoo Finance and enhanced with Plotly visualizations, it provides clear insights through candlestick charts, moving averages, trading volume bars, and raw data tables.

- **Custom Time Frame:** Select data periods ranging from 1 month to 10 years.
- **Flexible Intervals:** Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly data aggregation.
- **Technical Indicators:** View 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) overlaid on candlestick charts.
- **Interactive Candlestick Chart:** Explore price action with rich, interactive Plotly visuals.
- **Volume Insight:** Track trading volume with an interactive bar chart.
- **Data Transparency:** Inspect the last 20 rows of raw stock data in a sortable, filterable table.
- **Data Export:** Download the displayed data as a CSV file for further analysis.
